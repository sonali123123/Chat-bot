It combines three distinct techniques to achieve optimal muscular balance: deep tissue, muscle stripping and stretching. Muscle stripping is a deep tissue massage technique where the therapist targets a specific band of muscle fibers and applies pressure directly from the origin to the insertion of the muscle. Combined with stretching, muscle stripping helps break up scar tissue or muscle “knots,” which increases range of motion of joints, helps facilitate and quicken the healing process, increases the strength of muscle fibers and reduces pain.
